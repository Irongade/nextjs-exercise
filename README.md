# Welcome!

Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. As developers, we've taken technical tests before, and understand what a chore they can be, so we've designed this to allow you to show as much of your process as you'd like.

If you have any feedback on the exercise itself, feel free to email it to nicolas@teampeanut.com or/& yana@teampeanut.com (or invite https://github.com/nmenic01 or/& https://github.com/YarnSh39)

# Prerequisites.
